				<p>My family and I love the outdoors and being active. We are always going on hikes, camping trips, bike rides, you name it.
				My father and I inperticular, are the most active in our family. Whenever we see each other we always go on our morning runs
			and bike rides. When I was in the 9th grade, my parents wanted me to start some sort of sport, Volleyball or Basketball to be specific.
		This was first, because I loved sports, but also because I was 15 years old and 6 feet tall. Long story short, I chose basketball.
	I played on my highschool team, everyone amazed with my height and never letting me forget it;) I saw myself in local newspapers and webpages.
When I started studying at LCC International University, I got the chance to play on a profesional womens basketball team, named "Fortuna".
Although I am not playing on that team now, I will always love basketball (and sports) and will always find time to play!
(I even train girls weekly at LCC, who want to learn how to play.)  </p>

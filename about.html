			<h2>About My Family and I:) </h2>
				<div id="picture">
				<img src="family.jpg"/>
				<p>My family consists of my parents Zilvinas and Rasa,my older sister Urte, my younger sister Vaine, and youngest brother, Kalnius.
				My older sister and I were born in Lithuania, but when I turned 1 my parents older sister and I, migrated to the USA.
			We started off in Culvers City, California. Then it was considered "the ghetto" with shootings and police sirens all night.
		We lived in a studio apartment with another Lithuanian family, making it a total of 7 people in this little apartment space.
	As time went on, we all moved to Minnesota, where my younger siblings were born and where our hope for a better life grew.
Today, we live in Washington State. Although our lives are not perfect, still full with ups and downs, it is ours and we love it! </p>
